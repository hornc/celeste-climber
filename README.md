Mainly sprite and palette modifications.

## Known Issues / TODOs

* Some Madeline sprites aren't perfect, some need adjustment (for later)
* Topi palette needs switching (currently same as P1)
* Bonus level clouds palette needs switching (currently same as P1)
* Badeline palette not done (requires 2 player palette switching logic to be modified)
